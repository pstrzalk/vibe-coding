# Vibe Coding

## It's stupid

As a seasoned developer with over 20 years of commercial experience, I know that the so-called "Vibe Coding" can't produce production-ready results.

## It's fun

However, it's still fun to give it a try to find out what the fuss is about.

My attempts at creating things I need in my daily life, work, and free time.

### Learn irregular English verbs

My son has to learn 100+ irregular verbs for his English classes. We've all been there. Hopefully, it might be a bit easier, given the right vibes.

- Created with: Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 3-25. The context filled 156587 tokens.
- Lessons learned:
  - Do not mess with ThreeJS. It's MUCH easier to create a 2d game. Otherwise the model looses track of colisions/camera/rules.
  - It's easier to fix CSS widths manually than asking for it :)
  - Remember to switch to Gemini 2.5. The 2.0 version generates MUCH worse graphics and overall experience.

### Piggy Multiplication

My daughter has to learn the multiplication table and she's not happy... I asked her to choose any animal and she has chosed "a pig". Hence, he's "Piggy Multiplication"

- Created with: Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 3-25. The context filled 59000 tokens.
- Lessons learned:
  - the first version was AWESOME. I could have finished there if I really thought about a second step instead of blindly adding bad features
  - the model was able to come up with a pig SVG for the logo :)

### Save a Wolf

A 3D adventure game for learning the multiplication table. The goal is to save a wolf trapped on top of a tower by answering multiplication questions correctly.

- **Game mechanics**:
  - Collect one yellow box and one cyan box to be given a multiplication question
  - Answer multiplication questions to lower the tower with the wolf
  - Each correct answer lowers the tower
  - Each wrong answer raises it back up
  - Pull the tower all the way to the ground, then answer one more question and approach the wolf to save it
- Created with: Gemini 2.5 Pro. The context filled 40028 tokens.
- Technology: ThreeJS for 3D graphics and physics
