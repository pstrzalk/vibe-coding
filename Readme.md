# Vibe Coding

## It's stupid

As a seasoned developer, with over 20 years of commercial experience, I know that the so called "Vibe Coding" can't product production ready results.

## It's fun

However, it's still fun to give it a try to find out what the fuss is about.

### Learn irregular verbs in English

My son has to learn 100+ irregular verbs for his English classes. We've all been there. Hopefully, it may be a bit easier, given the right vibes.

- Created with: Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 3-25. The context filled 156587 tokens.
- Lesson learned:
  - Do not mess with ThreeJS. It's MUCH easier to create a 2d game. Otherwise the model looses track of colisions/camera/rules.
  - It's easier to fix CSS widths manually than asking for it :)
  - Remember to switch to Gemini 2.5. The 2.0 version generates MUCH worse graphics and overall experience.
